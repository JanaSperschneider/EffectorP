#### What is EffectorP?

Fungal plant pathogens secrete effector proteins that modulate the host cell to facilitate infection. 
Computational effector candidate identification and subsequent functional characterization delivers valuable insights 
into plant-pathogen interactions. However, effector prediction in fungi has been challenging due to a lack of unifying
sequence features such as conserved N-terminal sequence motifs. Fungal effectors are commonly predicted from secretomes 
based on criteria such as small size and cysteine-rich, which suffers from poor accuracy.

EffectorP is a machine learning method for fungal effector prediction in secretomes and has been trained to distinguish secreted proteins 
from secreted effectors in plant-pathogenic fungi.
EffectorP improves fungal effector prediction from secretomes based on a robust signal of sequence-derived properties.

***It is highly recommended to make the switch to the more accurate [EffectorP 2.0](https://github.com/JanaSperschneider/EffectorP-2.0).*** EffectorP 2.0 achieves an accuracy of 89%, compared with 82% for EffectorP 1.0 and 59.8% for a small size classifier.
